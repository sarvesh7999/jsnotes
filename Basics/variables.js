// Variables are memory spaces which contain some value and are referred in the code

// To define a variable we have 3 wways -- 
// 1. var - not used anymore
// 2. let
// 3. const

// Let -- 

let firstName = "Avinash"

console.log(firstName) // To display things on terminal. To use this file use "node filenmae"

firstName = "Sarvesh"

console.log(firstName)

// const -- 

const lastName = "Dubey"

console.log(lastName)

lastName  = "Sharma" // Not allowed

console.log(lastName)

// Difference between let and const -- 

// let will allow you to change the variable values but const is a constant value than can never be changed.
